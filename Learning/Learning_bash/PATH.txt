we have to add our script ot path variable so that it can be used anywhere
from the computer , echo $PATH to check the paths and check if the script 
path is present there  if not then we are supposed to add it
in home directory nano ~/.profile which is a hidden folder and add the path varibel there
export PATH = $PATH:the direcotry location

after saving he chagnes we have to source the ~/.profile folder which is kind of refreshing the new changes of the folder
